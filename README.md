**Topic**:Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models

**Abstract**：We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models,
a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational
bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic
models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a
generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset,
we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On
256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion.

## Third week paper sharing

**Date**: 2025-07-21 9:00-11:00 AM

**Topic**: SDE Perspective of Diffusion Models, Controllable Generation, and Recent Advances

**Abstract**：This talk introduces diffusion models from the perspective of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), explaining how continuous-time stochastic processes relate to discrete diffusion steps. It covers controllable generation techniques such as classifier guidance, classifier-free guidance, and conditional generation with various modalities. Additionally, the presentation highlights recent advances in diffusion models. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a clear understanding of both theoretical foundations and practical approaches in diffusion-based generative modeling.
